## **Project Link**
The app is deployed on Heroku: [Workout Tracker](https://mighty-ridge-79565.herokuapp.com/?id=5fd6d24eed4d956cd89d1166)
## **Description**
The Workout Tracker app is able to view, create and track daily workouts. Multiple exercises can be logged in a given day. Then the exercises can be tracked by name, type, weight, sets, reps, duration of exercise and distance traveled if it is a cardio exercise. The app uses a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handles routes with Express.
